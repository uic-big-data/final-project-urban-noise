	\section{Proposal}
	We propose to build an application which would aim at making the urban areas quitter by leveraging the spatial and temporal data captured by the sensors. We would use Multi Label Classification Machine Learning Algorithms on the given dataset to classify the audio files into various categorical sounds. We would also dwell more into understanding the mismatches which occur between the annotated and machine predicted data and also visually analyze the cause behind it.  Overall, this tool would give authorities a better overview and insights of noises around the city.
